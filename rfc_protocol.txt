Abstract
    This document provide a complete documentation for the communication
    between the server and client on the Epitech project's my_teams.

    Our goal is to provide a good protocol that allow us, to creat a new command
    easily and improve the existing one.

Syntax
    Each command is composed by a tag a space and a value and terminated by
    \r\n.
    [Command] [Space] [Value]
    Example: LOG ['user_name']\r\n

Command and return
    When you send a command to the server he send back a command you have to
    read. This command is composed by a code a space and a description ended
    by \r\n.
    [Code] [Space] [Description]
    101 ['uuid user_name']\r\n
